## ðŸ¦š Projects I'm proud of

### [PEPS](https://peps.life/) 
_March & April 2022_

After 5 months of intensive bootcamp, we gathered with the 4 mates of SLAT and build a webiste from scratch. We were supposed to build it on Rails x React but decided to test a new framework => Next JS, combining Node & React JS env.

We decided to build a collaborative cooking webiste whose main asset lies within the handling of the database.

Find [our repo](https://github.com/SLAF-Team/Peps).

### [Youlearnfrench](https://youlearnfrench.fr/)
_April 2022_

After 6 months of intensive bootcamp, I was asked by a French teacher friend to develop her portfolio website.
I did everything from scratch.

It's my first 100% made website made on : React JS with Parcel as a bundler, using Bootstrap as a design librairy, illustrations redesigned on Figma and powered by Netlify.

### [SLAF](https://syndicatdelutteantifranglais.club/)

After 2 months of full-stack classes at The Hacking Project, we've been asked to build our website from scratch build with rails.

I and 4 teemates came up with the idea of compiling anglicisms and their french equivalents.
